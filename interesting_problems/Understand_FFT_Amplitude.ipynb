      "The Parseval's Theorem tells us that the total power in the frequency domain should be equal to the time domain. So in my opinion, the amplitude of the time domain signal should be equal to the frequency domain magnitude. for example, in a simple case, you can think of a time domain sine wave signal is generated by adding two other sine wave signal with different frequency, when you do the fft transform, you should see 4 peaks (because of the complex conjugate symmetry in the frequency domain), so the amplitude in the frequency domain of a specific frequency (2 peaks) should be the same amplitude as the one in the time domain.
