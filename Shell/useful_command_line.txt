#In this file, I will keep a record of some of the useful command line
#Note all these commands are tested under bash. 

#1 show the calendar
cal 2 1015

#2 list long format files sorted by reverse time order with human readable format
ls -ltrh

#3 redirect and append to file of the output of a program
ls -l /usr/bin > ls-output.txt
ls -l /usr/bin >> ls-output.txt

#4 bash references standard input, output, and error as file descriptors 0, 1, and 2
#so if I want to log the standard error into a file
ls -l /bin/usr 2> ls-error.txt

#5 if we want to redirect output and error into one file there are two ways
#a) two redirections, the second is redirect file descriptor 2 to file descriptor 1
ls -l /bin/usr > ls-output.txt 2>&1
#b) ls -l /bin/usr &> ls-output.txt

# Disposing unwanted output (just ignore)
ls -l /bin/usr 2> /dev/null
